## Installation

Choose the installation method that best suits your needs:

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with Frames is using Docker. You'll need to mount a directory for your media files and provide the necessary environment variables:

```bash
docker pull elevenam/frames:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/your/media:/media \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@host:5432/frames" \
  -e DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@host:5432/frames" \
  -e REDIS_HOST="redis-host" \
  -e REDIS_PORT="6379" \
  -e REDIS_TTL="86400" \
  -e REDIS_DB="0" \
  -e JWT_SECRET="your-secure-jwt-secret" \
  elevenam/frames:latest
```

Replace the values with your actual configuration:
- `/path/to/your/media`: The local path where your media files are stored
- Database credentials: Your PostgreSQL connection details
- Redis configuration: Your Redis server details
- JWT secret: A secure random string for authentication

### Docker Compose (For Multi-Container Setup)

For a more complete setup including PostgreSQL and Redis, you can use Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  frames:
    image: elevenam/frames:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/media:/media
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://frames:frames_password@postgres:5432/frames
      - DIRECT_DATABASE_URL=postgres://frames:frames_password@postgres:5432/frames
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
      - REDIS_TTL=86400
      - REDIS_DB=0
      - JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis

  postgres:
    image: pgvector/pgvector:pg14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=frames
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=frames_password
      - POSTGRES_DB=frames
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

volumes:
  postgres_data: {}
  redis_data: {}
```

Save this as `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start Frames along with PostgreSQL and Redis containers, with data persistence through Docker volumes.

### Environment Variables

Frames requires the following primary environment variables:

- **Database Configuration**:
  - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (used for connection pooling)
  - `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`: Direct PostgreSQL connection string (used for migrations)

- **Redis Configuration**:
  - `REDIS_HOST`: Redis host
  - `REDIS_PORT`: Redis port (default: 6379)
  - `REDIS_TTL`: Redis TTL in seconds (default: 86400)

## Media Organization

For optimal performance and organization:

* **Movies**: It's recommended to place movie files directly in their own folders e.g., `MovieName (2023)/movie.mp4`
* **TV Shows**: Each show should be placed in its own folder, with subfolders for each season:
* **TV Episodes**: You have two options:
  * Place each episode in its corresponding Season folder (Recommended)
  * Place them directly in the Show folder if they follow naming conventions like "S01E01" or "S01 - E01"

    * Example:
        ```
        Movies/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MovieName (2023)/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ movie.mp4
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MovieName (2022)/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ movie.mp4
        TV Shows/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ShowName/
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Season 1/
           ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ S01E01 - EpisodeName.mp4
           ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ S01E02 - EpisodeName.mp4
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Season 2/
               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ S02E01 - EpisodeName.mp4
               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ S02E02 - EpisodeName.mp4

## Transcoding (Alpha Feature)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Feature Notice:** Transcoding is currently in alpha development and only available for local media files. I'm actively working towards a stable release. This experimental feature automatically converts your media files to different formats and quality levels, optimizing playback across various devices and network conditions for improved streaming performance.

To enable transcoding, use the `transcode` Docker tag and provide the `HLS_CACHE_DIRECTORY` environment variable with a mounted volume for cache storage:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/your/media:/media \
  -v /path/to/transcoding/cache:/transcoding \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@host:5432/frames" \
  -e DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@host:5432/frames" \
  -e REDIS_HOST="redis-host" \
  -e REDIS_PORT="6379" \
  -e REDIS_TTL="86400" \
  -e REDIS_DB="0" \
  -e JWT_SECRET="your-secure-jwt-secret" \
  -e HLS_CACHE_DIRECTORY="/transcoding" \
  elevenam/frames:transcode
```

**Note:** GroupWatch across multiple servers does not currently work in the transcoding branch.

## Coming Soon

- **Chromecast Support**: Cast your media to Chromecast-enabled devices (currently being redeveloped)
- **Permissions System**: Granular access control to specify which users can access specific media
